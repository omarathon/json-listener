# # json-listener

A tool to *indefinitely listen to the creation of .json files in a directory* and *automatically upload them to a Google Firebase*, utilising [FirebasePostJson](https://github.com/omarathon/firebase-post-json).

## Functionality

Inputs:

 - FirebaseConnection object, which may be intialised as in **Example.java** (or see **lib/firebasepostjson/lib/FirebaseConnection.java**) - this is to allow a connection to a Google Firebase.
 - Directory to listen for files in.
 - Directory to generate the logs in.
 
The listener may be run with the above data, listening in the input directory and generating a log within the input log directory. One is advisted to **run the listener in its own thread**, then to stop it by calling its **stop method**.

One may **schedule** the call to the **stop method**, to listen for a set amount of time. An example of such may be found in **Example.java**.

## Additional Listener Configuation

There are additional parameters one may configure their listener with, by using the associated **mutator methods** on their **JsonListener object** (they are *set to defaults* upon initialization):

 - **Max Threads** - set the maximum threads useable by the JVM while running the listener (it uses a potentially unbounded amount of threads if polling many locked files simultaneously).
 
 **Default Value:** **100**. **Mutator Method**: **setMaxThreads**.
 - **Max Locked File Tries** - The maxiumum number of attempts at polling a locked file to await its unlock. 
 
 **Default Value:** **100**. **Mutator Method**: **setLockedFileTries**.
 - **Poll Cooldown** - The listener's cooldown between each poll for FILE_CREATE events, in milliseconds. 
 
 **Default Value:** **100**. **Mutator Method**: **setPollCooldown**.
 - **Locked File Poll Cooldown** - The cooldown between each poll checking whether a locked file has became unlocked, in milliseconds. 
 
 **Default Value:** **100**. **Mutator Method**: **setLockedFilePollCooldown**.
 
## Dependencies

This project was developed via Maven, and used the following dependencies as libraries:

 - **[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** - com.google.firebase, firebase-admin
 - **[firebase4j](https://github.com/bane73/firebase4j)** - com.github.bane73, firebase4j
 - **[Google Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)** - com.google.code.gson, gson
 
One must install such dependencies within their project to allow the implementation of this tool.

Note that these dependencies come from [FirebasePostJson](https://github.com/omarathon/firebase-post-json), which was utilised within the project.

Below are the dependencies and repositories within the **pom.xml** when developing this project:

## Usage

One may use this tool by adding the above dependencies to their project, and storing **JsonListener.java**, as well as the **files within lib**, somewhere within their project. Then they may proceed to interact with **JsonListener** in an *examplar fashion* shown within **Example.java**.

**Note**: One may need to modify the package names of the files to fit their project.

## Main Files
 - **JsonListener.java** - The central file, listens in a directory indefinitely and posts a JSON file to a Google Firebase when a json file is created there.
 - **Example.java** - An examplar use of JsonListener.
 
## Auxiliary Files

One may find all of the auxiliary files within the **lib** directory.

 - **firebasepostjson** - This directory stores the required files for [FirebasePostJson](https://github.com/omarathon/firebase-post-json).
 
## Remark

One is recommended only to use this code within prototype systems - *it may not be safe for production*.
